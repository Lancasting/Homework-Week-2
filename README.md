# Homework-Week-2
Code Style html and css
Status: Completed
This is my portfolio page that I built for week 2 homework.
I tried to build it based on the images that were in the UofU folder.
Three pages of HTML and a CSS file to call out specific elements on the page.
The images are of me from the past year


Credits:
Ike from class helped me with getting the formatting right.
